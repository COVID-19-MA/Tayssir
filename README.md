يعيش المغرب منذ بداية شهر مارس 2020 ، أزمة الجائحة العالمية لفيروس كورونا المستجد covid-19 

في ظل هذه الأزمة ، أضطر عدد من المغاربة للتوقف عن أنشطتهم و أعمالهم اليومية  
الهدف من هذه المنصة هو مساندة الفئة الهشة من المجتمع المغربي خلال هذه المحنة ممن يمارسون مهن غير مهيكلة ، الحرة و الغير مصرح بهم لدى الصندوق الوطني  للضمان الإجتماعي.


In these days, Morocco is experiencing a huge crisis in light of the global pandemic of the new Coronavirus Covid-19, this situation has led many of Moroccan to stop their work, and the Moroccan authorities have taken several positive steps to relieve the citizens, and there is a fragile category of Moroccan society who engage in informal jobs and activities And those who are not affiliated in the National Social Security Fund (CNSS) will suffer a lot, and it will take time and great effort to collect their information from the authorities, and they are really in dire need..
This a platform dedicated to this category so that it helps collecting the least and most important information that the authorities need to access this category of society quickly and transparently, and the goal of designing this platform is to provide it as a means to facilitate access to information in relation to this category the authorities, and encourage them to take an initiative in favor of this poor community of people that aren't eligible to benefit from the compensation provided by  CNSS.
